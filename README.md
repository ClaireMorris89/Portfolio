# Portfolio

## Description 

I wanted a central place to send prospective employers to showcase my work and abilities. This website will serve as a professional portfolio where I keep and update all of my development projects, big and small.

Building this site has taught me the importance of a clear plan from the outset, to avoid coding issues once I get deeper into my process. Having an outline and goal in mind will help with my efficiency in the future

## Usage 

This website can be used as a resume for potential employers to visit when I am wanting to showcase my work and abilities. With clear information on myself, my work, and how to contact me via several different methods.

## Credits 

I added Urban Outfitters and Sephora's websites in "my work" section as fun placeholders until I have enough of my own work to replace these!
