             The most important things to know about me are that I love biking, reading, and Taylor Swift.
            Beyond that, it might be helpful to know that I love web development, and received my education thought the University of Utah's full-stack bootcamp.
            I also graduated from BYU with a BS in Psychology, and have owned my own event-planning business for the past 6 years. 
            Enjoy some of my work, and let's connect!
